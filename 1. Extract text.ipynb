    "The strip_html() function in Python typically refers to a custom function or method that you create to remove HTML tags from a given string containing HTML-formatted content. HTML tags are used to structure and format web content, and sometimes you may need to extract just the text content without the HTML tags for various purposes like data processing, analysis, or display.\n",

    "\"Denoising text\" in Python generally refers to the process of removing noise or unwanted elements from a piece of text to make it cleaner, more readable, and more suitable for further analysis or processing. The specific steps and techniques used for text denoising can vary depending on the context and the nature of the noise you want to eliminate. Here are some common tasks that are typically involved in text denoising:\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing HTML Tags and Markup: If your text contains HTML or other markup language, you might want to strip out these tags to extract the plain text content. You can use libraries like BeautifulSoup, as mentioned earlier, or regular expressions for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing Special Characters and Punctuation: Sometimes, text may contain unwanted characters, symbols, or punctuation marks that need to be removed to clean up the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase can help with consistency and reduce the impact of capitalization noise. However, this should be done carefully, as it may change the meaning of some words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing Stop Words: Stop words are common words like \"and,\" \"the,\" \"is,\" which often do not carry much meaning in text analysis. Removing them can reduce noise in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spell Checking and Correction: Text may contain spelling errors that can be corrected using spell-checking algorithms or libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization: Breaking text into words or tokens is a fundamental step in text processing. It can help in analyzing and cleaning individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming or Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root forms (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\") can help in reducing variation in text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing URLs and Email Addresses: If your text contains web links or email addresses, you might want to remove them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing Non-Alphanumeric Characters: In some cases, you may want to remove all non-alphanumeric characters, leaving only letters and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Non-Standard Characters and Encoding: Ensure that text is properly encoded to handle non-standard characters and symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific denoising techniques you use will depend on the nature of your text data and your analysis goals. It's common to create custom functions or scripts for text denoising tailored to the specific requirements of your project.\n",
